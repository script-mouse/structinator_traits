structinator is a library for easy implementation of `SpecifyCreatableStruct` from [`structinator_traits`](https://crates.io/crates/structinator_traits). Just add the attribute `#[iter_convertable]` to the struct you want to implement `SpecifyCreatableStruct`, and an automatic implementation of the trait will allow conversion between iterators and the structure of your choice! For more information, check this library's documentation below.
