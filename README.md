structinator_traits is designed to be used with [structinator](https://crates.io/crates/structinator), a library that automatically implements the `SpecifyCreatableStruct` trait. However, this library is also useful because it contains the type that the argument passed to `create_struct` must iterate over, or can be used to mix custom and automatic implementations of `SpecifyCreatableStruct`. For more information, check the documentation below.
